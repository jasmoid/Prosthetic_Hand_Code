Code created for the operation of a prototype prosthteic hand that incorporates an EMG sensor and moves motors proportionally to the strrngth of the EMG signal recieved.

Includes code that uses a push button to imitate tactile feedback, has a inbuilt thermistor to monitor the motors temperature and will stop hand operation when the motor is
overheating. 

Also uses a potentiometer embedded within finger joints to monitor finger angle and stop operation if this angle becomes extreme.
